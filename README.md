# E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System
# Product-recommendation-e-commerce system In order to offer users customized product recommendations based on their browsing and purchase history, I developed an e-commerce product recommendation system. This system analyzes user activity and generates recommendations using content-based filtering algorithms and collaborative filtering, which improves the shopping experience and increases revenue for e-commerce enterprises. ### Set of data I assigned unique identities to an Amazon dataset of customer ratings for electronic devices in order to prevent biases. The Amazon Electronics Rating Dataset Recommendation is a dataset that can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vibivij/download?datasetVersionNumber=1). ### Method 1. **Rank-Based Suggestion for Product** **Objective**: Solve the Cold Start Issue and suggest the most well-liked products to prospective clients. **Process**: Determine the mean and total number of ratings for every product. Offer the best products with the required number of minimal interactions.
The **Similarity-Based Collaborative Filtering** objective is to offer customized recommendations by analyzing the interactions of users who are similar to one another.
   - **Technique**: To locate comparable users, convert user IDs to integers, apply cosine similarity, and suggest products that similar users have interacted with but the actual user has not.

3. **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering** - **Goal**: Balance sparsity and scalability while offering customized recommendations based on prior behavior and preferences.
   - **Technique**: To forecast ratings, reduce dimensionality, and suggest the best products based on projected ratings, use SVD to a CSR matrix of product ratings.
   **Evaluation**: By contrasting actual and anticipated ratings, compute RMSE to assess model performance.
